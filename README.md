Placing the resulting folder in Assets/Assets/ should be enough to get the unity envirornment working.  Then compilation can occur normally.


## Relevant Scripts
There is a control script that handes all interaction with keyboard/peripherals.  VR configurations is a work in progress.

The other important script is that of ParticleCSV which parses a csv and plots stars.

## Action Items
- Virtual Reality Support for Oculus Quest
